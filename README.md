✅ Project Title: Recommendation System

📄 Project Description:
This project involves creating a simple recommendation system that suggests relevant items (such as movies, books, or products) to users based on their preferences or past behavior. The system uses foundational recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to generate meaningful and personalized suggestions.

The aim is to introduce the core concepts behind intelligent recommendation systems — widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.

🎯 Key Features:
Takes user input or preferences as the basis for recommendations.

Suggests items using:

Content-Based Filtering (recommends similar items based on item features)

or Collaborative Filtering (recommends based on user behavior similarities).

Simple terminal or web interface for interaction.

Works on a sample dataset (e.g., movies, books, products).

🧠 Learning Objectives:
Understand the difference between content-based and collaborative filtering.

Learn how similarity (cosine similarity, Pearson correlation) works in recommender systems.

Practice data preprocessing, feature extraction, and user-item matrix creation.

Gain experience working with pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for computing similarities (for content-based)

NumPy for matrix operations

(Optional) Streamlit / Flask for a web interface

📦 Sample Datasets to Use:
MovieLens dataset for movie recommendations

Amazon product review data

GoodBooks-10K dataset for book recommendations

🚀 Possible Enhancements:
Implement hybrid systems (combine both filtering methods).

Add a user login system to track preferences.

Integrate a web UI for better interactivity.

Include ratings, reviews, or tags for more personalized recommendations.

Use Matrix Factorization or SVD for scalable systems.
